### A 'useful' video tool.

##Note
This github is mainly used to host releases and act as a backup, therefore it only has the main structure of the program uploaded, not the entire project.

This is my first coding project and I have learnt alongside it and so there are undoubtedly a number of mistakes or (*probably extremely*) unoptimized code. If you can see a cruicial fault or want to offer improvement I do welcome it -- provided it's constructive.

## Features

* __Video Downloader__: You can rip video from over 50 sites across the internet. Please test out a site and the app will tell you if it's included. If not please pass it on and it will be included in the next update.
* __Converter__: You can convert to mp4, mp3, and GIF
* __Effects__:
* __Social Media__: Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Periscope, Twitch, Weibo, and even Tiktok because I need to stay relevant fellow kids.
* __TV__:  ITV Hub is covered out-of-the-box, however to download BBC iPlayer and Sounds you will install 'Get_iPlayer'.
* __Audio__: Sites such as Soundcloud, Bandcamp, and Audioboom are also covered.
* __Live Feeds__: Grab livestream codes from Youtube, Periscope, or Parliament Live if you're missing that excitement in your life.
* __Proxies__:
 * Custom Proxies: Ability to add a custom proxy has been added in settings.
 * Automatic Proxies: If a custom proxy is not set the app will automatically grab a free service online. Please note these may be tempremental, very slow, or most likely both.
* __Other Features__:
 * Dark Mode: Because why not.
 * Automatic URL Wiping:  to save those vital milliseconds.
 * Settings auto-saving.

## Thanks
This app is thanks to the tools made available by the teams behind __ffmepg, youtube-dl,__ and __get_iplayer__.
Additional thanks to __Dirk Vingerhoeds__ for his PyInstaStories code.
